The code for milestone 4 


The goal is to build, wire, and code a robot using VEX kit and RobotC. The robot had to be:                                                 
 -> Autonomously locate an IR emittin beacon                                                                                               
 -> Move towards it while carrying a "cable"                                                                                               
 -> Connect to the beacon without damaging it
